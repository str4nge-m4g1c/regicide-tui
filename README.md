# Kingslayer (Regicide TUI)

A Terminal User Interface (TUI) implementation of the cooperative card game **Regicide**, built in Rust with Ratatui.

## About Regicide

Regicide is a cooperative card game where players work together to defeat 12 powerful enemies (4 Jacks, 4 Queens, and 4 Kings). Players use numbered cards and special Animal Companions (Aces) to attack enemies while managing their hand and surviving enemy counterattacks.

## Features

- **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Solo play mode against AI
- Full game logic implementation with all card suit powers
- Beautiful ASCII TUI with enhanced 3-row layout
- Color-coded cards and game state
- Victory ranking system (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Real-time clock and session tracking
- Attack/defend visual indicators
- Quit confirmation dialog
- Scrollable game log and help screens
- Comprehensive test coverage (~20+ unit tests)
- Phase 2 (Planned): LAN-based multiplayer for 2-4 players

## Installation

### From Release Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/str4nge-m4g1c/regicide-tui/releases):

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `kingslayer-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`
- **macOS (Intel)**: `kingslayer-macos-x86_64.tar.gz`
- **Linux (x86_64)**: `kingslayer-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
- **Windows (x86_64)**: `kingslayer-windows-x86_64.zip`

Extract and run:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
tar -xzf kingslayer-*.tar.gz
./kingslayer

# Move to PATH (optional)
sudo mv kingslayer /usr/local/bin/
```

### From Source

**Prerequisites:**

- Rust 1.88+ (run `rustup update` to upgrade)
- A terminal with Unicode support

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/str4nge-m4g1c/regicide-tui.git
cd regicide-tui

# Build in release mode for optimal performance
cargo build --release

# Run the game
./target/release/kingslayer

# Or install to cargo bin
cargo install --path .
```

## How to Play

### Running the Game

```bash
# Or run directly with cargo
cargo run --release

# Or run the compiled binary
./target/release/kingslayer
```

### Controls

- **1-8**: Toggle card selection (select/deselect cards by index)
- **Enter**: Play selected cards / Confirm discard
- **Space**: Yield turn (skip to enemy attack)
- **j**: Use Jester power (solo mode - discard hand and draw fresh)
- **h**: Toggle help overlay
- **q**: Quit game

### Game Layout

The game interface is divided into three rows:

**Row 1 (Castle, Battlefield, Game Log):**

- **Castle (Left)**: Kingslayer logo with clock, current enemy card with HP bar and attack stats
- **Battlefield (Middle)**: Active shields, total damage, deck counts, and action prompts with visual indicators
- **Game Log (Right)**: Scrollable event log of recent game events and actions

**Row 2 (Your Hand):**

- ASCII art cards displayed horizontally
- Card numbers (1-8) shown below each card
- Card values displayed at the bottom

**Row 3 (Controls & Guide):**

- **Keyboard Actions (Left)**: Available keyboard commands
- **Game Rules Guide (Right)**: Scrollable quick reference for suit powers and mechanics

### Game Rules

Each turn consists of 4 steps:

1. **Input Phase**: Select and play card(s) from your hand
2. **Resolution Phase**: Suit powers activate and damage is applied
3. **Victory/Defeat Check**: Did you defeat the enemy?
4. **Enemy Attack Phase**: Survive by discarding cards

#### Suit Powers

- **♥ Hearts (Heal)**: Shuffle discard pile and move N cards to bottom of deck
- **♦ Diamonds (Draw)**: Draw N cards from the deck
- **♣ Clubs (Double Damage)**: Deal 2x damage to enemy
- **♠ Spades (Shield)**: Reduce enemy attack by N (cumulative)

*N = attack value of cards played*

#### Playing Cards

- **Single Card**: Play any card
- **Combo**: Play 2-4 cards of the same rank (total value ≤ 10)
- **Animal Companion (Ace)**: Value 1, can pair with any one other card to combine values and activate both suits
- **Jester**: Value 0, cancels enemy immunity, skips enemy attack, lets you choose who goes next

#### Enemy Mechanics

- **Immunity**: Each enemy is immune to their suit (e.g., Jack of Hearts is immune to Hearts powers, but damage still applies)
- **Exact Damage**: Defeat an enemy with exactly their HP to capture them (added to top of deck, worth more when drawn!)
- **Overkill**: Excess damage sends enemy to discard pile

| Enemy | HP | Attack |
|-------|----|----|
| Jack  | 20 | 10 |
| Queen | 30 | 15 |
| King  | 40 | 20 |

#### Defeat Conditions

- Cannot discard enough cards to survive enemy attack
- Cannot play any cards or yield

### Solo Mode

In solo mode, you start with 2 Jester powers that let you discard your hand and draw fresh cards. Your victory rank depends on Jester usage:

- **Gold Victory**: 0 Jesters used
- **Silver Victory**: 1 Jester used
- **Bronze Victory**: 2 Jesters used

## Development

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture and development notes.
